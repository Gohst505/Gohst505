As a recent graduate from Bloomtech lambda Institute of Technology, I have hands-on full-stack web development experience. I have been coding for a few years, but Bloomtech has been able to take my programming skills to a professional level. I have enjoyed building middleware and configuring APIs to support dynamic cloud applications using React, Express, Node, and JSON Web Tokens.
